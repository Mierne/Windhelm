# About Windlelm
Windhelm is an RPG adventure game set in a mysterious and magical forest, where the player takes on the role of a Shard. The game is programmed in the Batch scripting language for Windows, which allows it to be lightweight and easy to run on any Windows computer. The game's story begins with the Shard, a fragment of a travelers mind, waking up among the forest that surrounds Windhelm, which has historically protected The Kingdom of Fulkwinn from hostile kingdoms of the past. The forest is full of mystical creatures and ghouls, and at its center lies a strange castle called Windhelm. The player soon discovers that they are not alone in the forest and must navigate through dangerous territory to uncover the secrets of Windhelm and find their vessel, and to restore their mind.

The gameplay is simple and intuitive, with the player using keyboard commands to move their character through the forest, interact with objects, and battle enemies. The game is divided into locations and shops, each of which presents their own unique challenges for the player to overcome.

As the player explores the forest, they will encounter a variety of magical creatures, such as Ghouls, Guardians, Spirits and more. Some of the encounters in the Forest may help the Player with their ultimate goal, though be weary; for not all who roam the forest seek to guide, but to mislead. They may discover the secrets behind both Windhelm and the forest it lies within. They may even encounter other Shards, or memories, who have lost their way - their will having wavered, and their vessel having rotten. The Player may choose to assist these Shards or Memories heal or return to vessels.
